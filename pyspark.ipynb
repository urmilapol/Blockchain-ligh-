These lecture notes distill the architecture from the provided resource, structured for your data engineering classes with MSc students.[1]\n",
        "Origin and Key Features\n",
        "Spark originated in 2009 at UC Berkeley's AMPLab to address Hadoop MapReduce inefficiencies, becoming an Apache top-level project by 2014. Core strengths include in-memory computing for 100x speedups, unified analytics across batch/streaming/ML, polyglot support (Scala, Java, Python, R), and fault-tolerant RDDs with lazy evaluation via DAG execution.[2][1]\n",
        "Core Architecture Components\n",
        "Spark follows a master-worker model where the driver coordinates tasks across a cluster managed by YARN, Standalone, Mesos, or Kubernetes. Key elements include:\n",
        "•\tDriver Program: Runs main() with SparkContext; builds DAGs, schedules stages/tasks, monitors execution.[3][1]\n",
        "•\tCluster Manager: Allocates CPU/memory resources to worker nodes.[1]\n",
        "•\tExecutors: Worker processes on nodes; execute tasks, cache data in memory/disk, handle shuffles.[4][3]\n",
        "•\tWorker Nodes: Host multiple executors for parallel processing.[1]\n",
        "Fundamental Abstractions\n",
        "RDDs enable immutable, distributed data with lineage for recomputation on failure, while DAGs optimize transformation chains into stages. Execution flow: submit app → driver builds/optimizes DAG → scheduler assigns tasks → executors process with data locality and speculative execution.[5][1]\n",

While Hadoop is a comprehensive ecosystem for storage and processing, Spark is a high-performance engine specifically designed for speed and flexibility.1\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary technical difference is that Hadoop MapReduce is disk-based, whereas Apache Spark is memory-based.2\n",

        "________________________________________\n",
        "Key Comparison: Hadoop vs. Spark\n",
        "Feature\tApache Hadoop (MapReduce)\tApache Spark\n",
        "Primary Strength\tCost-effective storage & batch processing.\tHigh-speed, in-memory computation.\n",
        "Data Processing\tBatch only. Processes data in large, scheduled chunks.\tBatch + Streaming. Can process data in near real-time.\n",
        "Speed\tSlower (reads/writes to disk for every step).\tFast (up to 100x faster by keeping data in RAM).\n",

        "________________________________________\n",
        "Architectural Differences\n",
        "1. Processing Model\n",
        "•\tHadoop (MapReduce): Operates in a rigid two-step \"Map\" and \"Reduce\" phase.3 After every step, it must write the intermediate results to the physical disk.4 This makes it highly reliable but introduces significant I/O latency.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "•\tSpark uses Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs).11 Instead of replicating data, it remembers the \"lineage\" (the sequence of instructions) used to create a dataset. If a machine fails, Spark simply re-runs those instructions on the original data to recover the lost part.12\n",

        "\n",
        "________________________________________\n",
        "Which one should you use?\n",
        "•\tChoose Hadoop if you have massive amounts of \"cold\" data (petabytes) where storage cost is more important than speed, or if you are running long-running batch ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs that don't need to finish in seconds.13\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "•\tChoose Spark if you need to process data in real-time (like fraud detection), if you are building Machine Learning models that require multiple passes over the same data, or if you want a faster, more modern development experience with Python (PySpark).14\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: Most modern data platforms use both. They use Hadoop (HDFS) to store the data cheaply and Spark to process it quickly.\n",
